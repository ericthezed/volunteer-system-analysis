Analysis of Volunteer Feature

This analysis measured user engagement with a feature designed for connecting animal shelters and rescue groups with prospective volunteers. It compared conversion rates for important actions and goals (e.g., logging into the feature, searching for volunteers or opportunities, viewing volunteer profiles, and sending inquiries) across various segments of users, such as shelters vs. rescue groups, volunteers vs. non-volunteers, and returning vs. first-time users. It also analyzed where abandonments most commonly occur on the sign-up form, and measured the most (and least) popular selections on the volunteer search form. This analysis helped to better understand how different user segments engaged with this feature, which led to important insights for optimizing its effectiveness, such as redesigning the sign-up and search forms, improving the visibility of certain features, and modifying how volunteer opportunities are displayed to users.
